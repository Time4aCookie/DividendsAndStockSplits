# DividendsAndStockSplits — Daily Workflow

## What this project does
After market close each trading day, check every equity position (and any GTC orders)
for stock splits and dividend ex-dates occurring the **next trading day**.
Claude runs everything — the user's only job is to drop the Excel file(s) in this
folder and say "run the daily check."

---

## How to trigger the daily check

The user will say something like:
- "run the daily check"
- "check today's events"
- "run the workflow"

When this happens, follow the steps below **without asking the user to type anything
in the terminal.** Claude runs all scripts directly.

---

## Daily Workflow — Claude executes all of this

### Step 1 — Find the Excel file(s)
```bash
ls *.xlsx 2>/dev/null; ls *.xls 2>/dev/null
```
- The **positions file** matches: `position*.xlsx`, `holding*.xlsx`, `trades*.xlsx`,
  or is the only `.xlsx` present.
- The **GTC file** matches: `gtc*.xlsx`, `order*.xlsx`.
- If multiple ambiguous files exist, show the list and ask the user which is which.
- If no file is found, tell the user to drop the Excel into this folder and try again.

### Step 2 — Inspect the positions file and confirm the ticker column
```bash
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel('<filename>', dtype=str, nrows=5)
print(df.columns.tolist())
print(df.head())
"
```
Show the user the detected columns and first few rows. Confirm which column contains
tickers before proceeding. The script auto-detects columns named: `ticker`, `symbol`,
`sym`, `stock`, `security`, `instrument` — or falls back to the first column.
If the real column name is different, note it and adjust.

### Step 3 — Determine the target date
```bash
date +%Y-%m-%d
```
Target = next **trading day** from today (skip Saturday and Sunday).
This does NOT account for market holidays — mention this to the user on holiday eves.

### Step 4 — Run the Python scraper
```bash
python check_events.py <positions_file> --no-email
```
With GTC orders (once format is confirmed):
```bash
python check_events.py <positions_file> --gtc <gtc_file> --no-email
```
This produces:
- `output/python_results_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
- `output/python_results_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- `output/unchecked_tickers_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` — only if some tickers could not be verified

**Modes & runtime:**
- **Fast mode (default)** — ~1 minute. Benzinga bulk dividend calendar + Investing.com
  AJAX bulk (each 1 request, both cover ADRs/CEFs; Benzinga gross amounts win the
  merge) + MarketBeat (1 request) + StockAnalysis per-ticker verification of position
  hits only. Use this for the daily check — always.
- **Deep mode (`--deep`)** — **NOT VIABLE at this portfolio's scale (~1400 tickers).**
  Tested 2026-06-11: StockAnalysis's rate limiter has a budget far below 1400
  requests — the sweep ran 3 hours, spent ~100% of its time in 429 backoff loops,
  and was killed unfinished. Even an 8-hour quiet gap did not reset the budget.
  Only use `--deep` for small ticker sets. The effective audit of fast mode is the
  **union of the two independent comprehensive calendars** (Benzinga + Investing.com,
  which have different blind spots) plus Claude's independent Step 5 checks.

**After midnight:** the default target date is the next trading day from *today* —
if running after midnight for that same morning's market open, pass
`--date YYYY-MM-DD` explicitly or the script will target the following day.

**If the output reports UNCHECKED tickers**, the report is INCOMPLETE — some tickers
could not be verified (rate limit/errors). This is automatically appended to the
discrepancy list, which blocks the auto-send path. Re-run later or verify those
tickers manually (list in `output/unchecked_tickers_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`). Never present
a run with unchecked tickers as a clean "no events" day.

### Step 5 — Claude's independent check
The Python script checks 1000+ tickers individually; Claude cannot re-fetch them all.
Claude's check is targeted:

1. **Splits calendars (bulk)** — fetch all three, filter to target date, match against positions:
   - `https://stockanalysis.com/actions/splits/` — missed VRNO on 2026-06-11; never rely on it alone
   - `https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/stock-splits` — explicit Ex-Date column; covers OTC and BATS ETFs
   - `https://www.investing.com/stock-split-calendar/` — date-grouped table; ticker in parens
2. **Verify every split hit via press release** — splits are corporate actions the company
   itself announces, which makes this the only check truly independent of all calendars.
   For each split found (by the script or the calendars), fetch
   `https://www.stocktitan.net/news/TICKER/` and confirm the company announced the split
   with matching ratio and effective date. If StockTitan has nothing, WebSearch
   `"<company> reverse stock split <date>"` for the press release. A split hit with no
   findable announcement is a discrepancy — flag it.
3. **Dividend calendars (bulk)** — match against positions:
   - `https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/dividends` — PRIMARY: covers ADRs (BABA),
     CEFs (RA), preferred series; shows declared GROSS amounts. Filter Ex-Date column
     to target date.
   - `https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/ex-dividend-date/YYYY-MM-DD/` — secondary;
     US equities only, and the page IGNORES the URL date (shows recent announcements
     with mixed ex-dates — always filter by the Ex-Dividend Date column).
4. **Verify every Python dividend hit per-ticker** — for each ticker the Python script
   reported, fetch `https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/TICKER/dividend/` and confirm the
   ex-date and amount match. (If `stocks/` 404s, try `etf/`.)
   **ADR amount trap:** for ADRs (BABA, etc.), StockAnalysis lists the dividend NET of
   the ~$0.02/ADS depositary fee (e.g. shows $1.030 when Alibaba declared $1.05).
   For any ADR hit, verify the declared gross amount via the company's 6-K/press
   release or MarketBeat — the gross is what the price drops by on ex-date, so the
   gross is what goes in the report and GTC adjustments.
5. **Re-check UNCHECKED tickers** — if the script reported unchecked tickers
   (`output/unchecked_tickers_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`), fetch those per-ticker pages
   individually if there are a handful; if there are many, re-run the script later
   instead. Do not skip this.
6. **Spot-check known payers** — positions known to pay monthly (e.g. RA) or with
   recently announced events, even if nothing else flagged them.

Filter all results: only keep tickers whose **underlying** matches a position.

**Why dividends are per-ticker (as of 2026-06):** every bulk dividend calendar tested
(NASDAQ API, StockAnalysis calendar, EarningsWhispers, Finviz, Yahoo, WSJ, Barchart,
Seeking Alpha) is either broken, bot-blocked, or misses ADRs/CEFs — MarketBeat's
calendar listed 18 tickers for 2026-06-11 but missed both BABA and RA. Per-ticker
pages are the only source that reliably covers everything.

### Step 6 — Write Claude's findings
Write to `output/claude_results_YYYY-MM-DD.json`:
```json
[
  {"underlying": "BABA", "event_type": "dividend", "amount_or_ratio": "$1.030", "sources": ["StockAnalysis"]},
  {"underlying": "SHPH", "event_type": "split",    "amount_or_ratio": "1 for 10", "sources": ["StockAnalysis", "NASDAQ"]}
]
```
Write `[]` if nothing found — this signals the check completed with no hits.

### Step 7 — Run comparison
```bash
python check_events.py <positions_file> --no-email
```
The script detects the Claude JSON and runs `compare.py` automatically,
printing agreements and discrepancies.

### Step 8 — Report to the user
Present a clear summary:
- Splits found (ticker, ratio, confirmed by which sources)
- Dividends found (ticker, amount, confirmed by which sources)
- GTC orders affected (if GTC file was provided)
- Discrepancies — call these out explicitly: **"NEEDS MANUAL VERIFICATION"**
- Items both sources agreed on

### Step 9 — Send the email
**Always send the email**, whether or not any events were found. A "nothing found" email is expected and confirms the check ran.

If there are **no discrepancies** (including the case where nothing was found): send automatically.
```bash
python check_events.py <positions_file>
```

If there are **discrepancies**: tell the user what they are, then ask:
> "There are X discrepancies that need manual verification (listed above).
> Do you want me to send the email now with the discrepancies flagged in red,
> or verify first and send after?"

Only send after the user confirms in the discrepancy case.

## Ticker Parsing Rules (extract underlying before checking)

Apply in this order — first match wins:

| Instrument | Pattern examples | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Human-readable option | `AVGO JUN 05 2026 310.00 PUT`, `XRX JAN 21 '28 7 CALL`, `ASST2 JAN 15 '27 3 CALL` | Extract first word as underlying. Year may be 4-digit (`2026`) or apostrophe form (`'28`). Underlying may contain a digit (`ASST2`). |
| OCC option | `AAPL240119C00150000` | Extract leading symbol as underlying |
| Space share class | `WSO B` | Convert to dot form: `WSO.B` |
| Warrant (separator) | `ACMR.WS`, `ACMR.WT`, `ACMR.W` | Strip suffix — unambiguous |
| Right / Unit (separator) | `ACMR.R`, `ACMR.U` | Strip suffix — unambiguous |
| Preferred (separator) | `BAC.PA`, `BAC-PA` | Strip suffix; check underlying `BAC` |
| Share class | `BRK.A`, `BRK-B` | Keep full ticker (normalize dash to dot: `BRK.B`) |
| **Bare suffix — AMBIGUOUS** | `ACMRW`, `BACPA`, `BACPRA`, `GLW`, `AMPG` | Check **BOTH** the full ticker AND the stripped form |
| Common stock | `AAPL`, `BABA`, `RA` | No change |

**Bare-suffix ambiguity (critical):** a trailing `W`/`R`/`U` or `PA`–`PH`/`PRA`–`PRH`
with no dot/dash separator cannot be disambiguated: `GLW` is Corning (common stock),
not a GL warrant; `AMPG` is AmpliTech (common stock), not AM preferred. But `ZOOZW`
really IS a ZOOZ warrant. So ambiguous tickers are checked under BOTH interpretations —
the full ticker and the stripped underlying. This can produce occasional false-positive
hits (e.g. a GL dividend attributed to a GLW position) — flag them for the user to
dismiss; that is far cheaper than missing a real event. Bare-suffix stripping is
skipped when the stripped form would be a single character (`AU` stays `AU`).

**Human-readable option detection**: if the ticker string contains a space AND contains
a month name (Jan–Dec) AND ends with CALL or PUT, extract everything before the first
space as the underlying.

When in doubt, err on the side of checking — a false positive is cheaper than a miss.

## GTC Order Adjustment Logic

> **Note:** GTC export format is being confirmed. This section will be updated once the
> broker export is shared.

When a position has a split or dividend ex-date tomorrow:

**Dividends:**
- Flag any open BUY limit orders — the stock opens ~`dividend_amount` lower on ex-date.
  Suggest adjusting the limit down by the dividend amount.
- Flag open SELL limit orders for the same reason.

**Stock Splits:**
- Flag ALL open orders on the underlying.
  Price ÷ split ratio, quantity × split ratio.
  Some brokers auto-adjust for splits — note this and tell the user to confirm with their broker.

## Known Source Issues (as of 2026-06-10)

| Source | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| StockAnalysis splits calendar | ✓ Working | Splits source 1 of 3. Data is in a SvelteKit inline script (JS object literals, `$`-prefixed symbols). **Missed VRNO on 2026-06-11** — never use alone. |
| Benzinga splits calendar | ✓ Working | Splits source 2 of 3. Server-rendered table, explicit Ex-Date per row. Caught VRNO when StockAnalysis missed it. |
| Investing.com splits calendar | ✓ Working | Splits source 3 of 3. Date-grouped table (date only on first row of each group). Also caught VRNO. |
| StockTitan per-ticker news | ✓ Working | Split verification: `stocktitan.net/news/TICKER/` surfaces the company's own split press release (ratio + effective date). Used in Claude's Step 5, not by the script. |
| Benzinga dividends calendar | ✓ Working | PRIMARY dividends source — one request covers the whole market incl. ADRs (BABA $1.05 gross) and CEFs (RA). Found 60 tickers for 2026-06-11 when NASDAQ API found 6 and MarketBeat 0. |
| Investing.com dividends AJAX | ✓ Working | Second comprehensive bulk (script-only — POST endpoint, Claude's WebFetch cannot POST). Covers ADRs/CEFs incl. foreign Y-suffix ADRs Benzinga misses; Benzinga uniquely covers some preferreds/CEFs. ADR amounts NET of fees — Benzinga gross wins the merge. |
| StockAnalysis per-ticker dividends | ⚠ Hit verification ONLY | Fine for a handful of requests (verifying hits). **Cannot sustain full-portfolio sweeps** — daily request budget is far below 1400; a 2026-06-11 sweep attempt spent 3 hours in 429 backoff and was killed. ADR amounts shown NET of depositary fee — use Benzinga/6-K gross. |
| NASDAQ HTML splits page | ✗ JS-rendered | Raw HTML has no data rows — always returned 0. Removed 2026-06-10. |
| MarketBeat dividends calendar | ✓ Working | Supplementary — US equities only; missed BABA and RA on 2026-06-11 |
| NASDAQ API (splits + dividends) | ✗ Timeout | Removed |
| NASDAQTrader splits file | ✗ 404 | Removed |
| TipRanks splits API | ✗ 403 Forbidden | Removed |
| StockAnalysis dividends calendar | ✗ 404 | Removed |
| EarningsWhispers | ✗ Error page | Removed |
| Yahoo Finance batch quote API | ✗ 401 | Tested 2026-06-10 — now requires auth |
| WSJ / Barchart / Seeking Alpha / dividend.com calendars | ✗ 404/blocked | Tested 2026-06-10 |

## Output Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `output/python_results_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` | Python findings — attached to email |
| `output/python_results_YYYY-MM-DD.json` | Python findings in JSON — used for comparison |
| `output/claude_results_YYYY-MM-DD.json` | Claude's findings — written in Step 6 |
| `output/unchecked_tickers_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` | Tickers the script could NOT verify (rate limit/errors) — only written when non-empty. Presence means the report is incomplete. |

The `output/` directory and all `.xlsx` files are gitignored.

---

## Discrepancy Policy

| Scenario | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Both agree | High confidence | Proceed |
| Claude only | Python scraper missed it | **Verify manually before acting** |
| Python only | Claude missed a source | **Verify manually before acting** |
| INCOMPLETE CHECK warning | Rate limiting / fetch errors — some tickers never verified | **Treat as a discrepancy.** Re-run or verify the unchecked list before trusting the report |

Never act on a discrepancy without human confirmation. The email flags these in red.
